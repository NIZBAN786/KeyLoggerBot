## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, understanding the mechanisms behind malicious software is crucial for developing effective defense strategies. This project focuses on building an educational keylogger with encrypted data exfiltration capabilities as part of Project #3 from the cybersecurity internship curriculum. The objective is to create a proof-of-concept that demonstrates keystroke logging, data encryption, and simulated data exfiltration techniques in a controlled, educational environment.

Keyloggers represent one of the most significant threats in modern cybersecurity, capable of capturing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal communications. By developing and analyzing this educational implementation, we gain valuable insights into both offensive and defensive cybersecurity techniques, preparing us to better protect against such threats in professional environments.

## Abstract

This project successfully implements a cross-platform educational keylogger that captures keystrokes, encrypts the data using Fernet symmetric encryption, and simulates data exfiltration through a Flask web server. The implementation includes essential security features such as timestamp logging, startup persistence mechanisms, and kill switch functionality. All development was conducted within strict ethical guidelines, emphasizing educational value and responsible cybersecurity practices.

The keylogger operates silently in the background while maintaining complete audit trails and user consent mechanisms. The encrypted logs are stored locally and can be viewed through a web-based dashboard, demonstrating both data collection and retrieval techniques commonly used in cybersecurity scenarios. The project showcases cross-platform compatibility, working seamlessly on both Windows and Linux systems.
